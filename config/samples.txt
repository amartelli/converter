$ This is a test configuration for the DAnalysis analyser/skimmer
$ Comments can be added following a "$"
$
$ The first part described the general configuration of the analyser
$ The output directory will be created in the directory the analyser is
$ run from
$ The output file will be created within the output directory and will
$ contain any histogram that was initialised (see skelton analyser sourcecode)
$ It is also possible to create a flat ntuple or a skim. In this case,
$ each sample will result in a unique output file containing the ntuple or skim.
$ In addition, a new configuration file (like this) will be created that allows 
$ to run over the new skim/ntuple with the DAnalysis framework, too, taking
$ care of proper normalisation etc.
